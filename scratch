Update types are as follows

1 Push: Alice knows Bob and Carol. Alice pushes Bob's address to Carol.

2 Push: Alice knows Bob. Alice pushes Alice's address to Bob.

3 Pull: Alice knows Bob. Bob knows Carol. Alice requests an address from Bob. Bob sends Carol's address to Alice.

4 Global pull: Alice requests an address from a seed server or from megacache.

5 Forget: Alice forgets Bob's address.

Effects on degree are

1 High in-degree grants higher out-degree. 

2 High in-degree grants higher out-degree.

3 High in-degree grants higher in-degree.

4 Low in-degree can be raised

5 High out-degree's and in-degree's decay faster

So

1 fixes star topologies

2 stops people being disconnected by in-degree

3 ...

4 stops people being disconnected by total 

5 reduces links, lowers memory usage

Time for python script to scale this up

Script works

Pull is awkward to sync because rate relies on non-local knowledge. Is pull needed in light of push_self?

Fix push rates to match in full_model and model. Check that pushes can be assumed to be uniformly chosen.
